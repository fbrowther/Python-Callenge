# Python-Challenge
Analysis on two datasets (PyPoll) and (PyBank) were completed as a part of the Python activity challenge.

PyPoll analysis:
This allowed for the use of an election data from a small town. This dataset composed of three information "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 
The entire analysis was carried out on Visual studio code employing Python script. The analsyis consisted of calculating (a) the total number of the votes casted by the voters followed by (b) a list of candidates who received votes,(c)the total number of votes received by each candidates, (d)the percentage votes won by each candidate and finally (e) the winner of the election based on majority votes received. The result of the analysis was recorded in a separate txt file.

PyBank analysis:
Likewise, revenue data from a representative small company was used to carry out the anlysis. The data consisted of 
"Dates" and "Profit/loss" and this data was used to calculate (i)the total number of months the dataset represented, (ii) the total amount of profit/losses recorded, (iii) the changes in the profit/losses for the total months and (iv) the greatest increase or (v) greatest decrease over the entire period. The result of the analysis was recorded in a separate txt file.

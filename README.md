Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
-------------------------
Winner: Diana DeGette
-------------------------


PyBank analysis 
This allowed for the use of Profit/losses data from a representative small company. This dataset was analysed to calculate (i)the total number of months the dataset represented, (ii) the total amount of Profit/Losses recorded for the entire period, (iii) the changes in the Profit/Losses over the analysis period and (iv)the greatest increase or (v) greatest decrease over the entire period. The results ouput for this anlaysis was as follows-

Financial Analysis

Total months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $4448.127906976744
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
